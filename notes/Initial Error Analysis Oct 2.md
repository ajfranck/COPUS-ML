Note: How easy it is for the human eye to tell

Strong(Consistency)

* Lec:Lecture
* L:Listening
* FUp:Follow up questions
* RtW:Real-time writing
* SQ: Student asks question
* AnQ:Teacher listens to and answers question
* MG: Moving through class
* OoO: one on one discussion with one or a few individuals(can be along AnQ and MG)

Weak(Consistency)

* DV:Conducting demo, experiments, etc(includes videos)
* Adm:Administration
* CQ:Asking a clicker question(Not included in spreadsheet)
* CG:Discuss clicker question in groups(Not included in spreadsheet)
* TW: Waiting(When the instructor can be interacting or listening to student/groups and is not doing so){Instructor bias}\[Ask the model: could the instructor be interacting/listening in this moment?]

May be confusing(need to check)

* WC:Students engaged in whole class discussion by offering explanations, opinions, judgement to whole class
* SP:Student Presentation(As of first 4 lectures, no data)
* SO:Student Other
* TO:Teacher Other
* TQ:Test/quiz
* Prd:Student making prediction about outcome of D/V(Audio test)
* Ind:Student individual thinking/problem solving(maybe can chalk this down to whenever the teacher asks a non-rhetorical question)
* PQ: Posing non-clicker question(needs to be non-rhetorical so check audio and if model can tell if it's rhetorical\[subjective sometimes])

Things to test on the model

* Audio(what the teacher is saying and if the model can properly hear and analyze the words)
* Audio(Student output differential)
